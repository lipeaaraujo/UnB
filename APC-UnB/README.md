# APC_FGA_UnB
My repository for the college course "Algoritmo e Programação de Computadores"
- Teacher: Giovanni Almeida Santos

This repository contains all the exercises I solved during the course using the pseudo-programming language Calango and C, my first project using Calango, and my final project, using C.

## Calango
Calango is an educational software that interprets pseudo-code written in Portuguese, it has a similar structure, syntax, and organization to most programming languages, especially the C programming language. More about Calango can be found [here.](https://github.com/GeovanaRamos/calango)

- <b>[Estruturas Condicionais](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/Calango/estruturasCondicionais):</b> exercise list about conditional structures.
- <b>[Estruturas de Repetição](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/Calango/estruturasRepeti%C3%A7%C3%A3o):</b> exercise list about repetition structures.
- <b>[Estruturas Sequenciais](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/Calango/estruturasSequenciais):</b> exercise list about sequential structures.
- <b>[Modularização](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/Calango/modulariza%C3%A7%C3%A3o):</b> exercise list about code modularization.
- <b>[Vectors](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/Calango/vetores):</b> exercise list about arrays and vectors.
## [Projeto Calango](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/blob/main/Calango/Projeto%20Calango%20-%20Equa%C3%A7%C3%B5es%20por%20Pontos)
My Calango project, it takes in point coordinates in the cartesian plane inserted by the user, and calculates line, circumference or parabola equations and their roots according to the user's option.

## C
In the second part of the course, we were introduced to actual C programming.

- <b>[Lista 1](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/C/Lista%201):</b> exercise list about basic C syntax and conditional statements.
- <b>[Lista 2](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/C/Lista%202):</b> exercise list about repetition structures and functions.
- <b>[Lista 3](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/C/Lista%203):</b> exercise list about arrays and all previous topics in general.
## [Trabalho em C](https://github.com/LipeAKugel/APC-FGA_UnB/tree/main/C/Trabalho%20em%20C/main)
My final project, made using C, it is a console application that simulates the administration of a solar panel energy distribution company. It has a CRUD system of power plants, consumers, and contracts. The program uses files to register and save everything registered during the execution.
